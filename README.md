Mandelbrot
==========

A simple .net application that draws a mandelbrot set. Numerous options are available to modify the resulting image,
such as relative position and scale.

Image controls:
- Left click
- - Move to that location

- Right click
- - Move to that location, and zoom 2x

Button controls:
- Coordinates
- - Set an X/Y offset to move the image

- Scale
- - Set a scale to zoom in/out

- Iterations
- - More iterations result in a more detailed image, but slows down rendering

- Threads
- - Control the number of threads used to calculate the set

- Run
- - Draw the mandelbrot as defined

- Reset
- - Reset all variables to their default setting
